# Perfume Shops Social Media & Website Management
## 2023-2023
## Project Overview
This project involved managing the website and social media presence for a chain of perfume shops across Dubai, Kuwait, and Qatar. Initially, my role was to handle the website, but it expanded to include Instagram management for each region. I created three separate Instagram accounts and grew the follower base through strategic content and targeted campaigns.

Due to my focus on computer engineering studies, I eventually stepped away from leading the social media efforts, but the foundation and growth were already established.

## Technologies Used
- **Website Platform:** Wix
- **Social Media Platform:** Instagram

## Instagram Growth and Management
For each region, a dedicated Instagram account was created and managed:
- **Kuwait**: Grew the account to thousands of followers with region-specific content and engagement      strategies.
- **Qatar**: Managed local promotions and interactions to boost brand visibility.
- **Dubai**: Focused on market-specific trends to connect with followers.

## Website
The website was designed to provide an easy and engaging experience for users to browse and shop for perfumes.


## Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience in both website management and social media strategy. It gave me hands-on experience in managing a real-world business, growing its online presence, and understanding how to create engagement strategies that work for different markets.
